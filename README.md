# Featured Icon

**Hello Theme Developers!**

Have you ever added a Featured Image to a post and thought to yourself, 'I wish I could do the same thing but for an icon.'? Now you can! "Featured Icons" mirrors the Featured Images functionality of WordPress. The Featured Icon metabox behaves almost exactly like Featured Images (even better, because they work when JS is disabled), and make use of  WordPress's built in Media Manager. Users can select images, define the order, and save the gallery, all through a simple drag-n-drop interface.

**Note**: This is not a plugin which will add galleries to your website. This is for theme developers. It handles the backend interface for selecting a featured icon for each post and storing that as metadata. Themes can then make use of this however they want.

### Documentation
